        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p><em><b>Black swan(Cygnus atratus)</b></em>, is a species of swan, which is primarily found in southwest regions of Australia, where it is native. It is a species of swan, a large bird with mostly black body and red bill. It is also found in New Zealand, United Kingdow, Japan, United States and China.<br>The black swan can be found singly, in small groups or even in hundreds and thousands. It is also popular in zoos and gardens. This is what black swans sound like:</p>

            <p>Black swans are mostly black feathered, but do have white feathers for flight. They measure between 110 cm and 142 cm in length and weight between 3.7 kg and 9 kg, with wingspan between 1.6 meters and 2 meters. The beck is very long and their bodies are curved have a S-shape. Males are slightly larger than females.<br>The reason for the black colour is believed to be because the bird can camouflage itself against the backdrop of mud besides river, while the white swan has evolved to conceal itself against the background of snow.</p>
        <h2 id="beh">Behaviour</h2>
        <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
            <p>The black swan is vegetarian and diet generally consists of acquatic, marshland plants and algae. The diet of the black swan is similar to that of white swans. The diet can change depending on the water level. Food habits can also change with change in the swan's environment, primarily water level.</p>
        <h3 id="rep">Reproduction</h3>
            <p>The species is largely monogamous, with 1/4th of the pairings being homosexual. Black swan's nest is made up of reeds, grasses and weeds between 1 metre and 1.5 metres in diameter and 1 metre high. They mostly build their nests in shallow water or on islands, and the nest is reused every year. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the incubation period, which lasts for 35 days to 40 days. After eggs hatch, cygnets are tended by parents for about 9 months.</p>
        <h2 id="hab">Habitat</h2>
            <p>The black swan's prefered habitat is fresh, brackish and salt water lakes, swamps and rivers with access to food and nesting materials. The black swan is nomadic, with it prefering to migrate to habitats where it can best survive during changes in weather.<br>The black swan is native to Australia, where it is protected and cannot be shot. The species was also introduced in New Zealand, United Kingdom, Japan, China and United States. </p>
        <h2 id="pop">Popular culture</h2>
        <h3 id="his">History</h3>
            <p>Black swan was used in ancient Europe to describe rare events, first coined by Roman satirist Juvenal in <time>82 AD</time>. For a long time people in Europe believed that black swans did not exist, and that all swans were white because only white swans were native to Europe. Black swans were believed to be like unicorns. Dutch navigator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Vlamingh" target="_blank">Willem de Vlamingh</a> found black swans in Western Australia in 1697.</p>

                    The central idea to The Black Swan is that rare events cannot be estimated from empirical observation since they are rare.
